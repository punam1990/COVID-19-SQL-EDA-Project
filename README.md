Problem Statement:
Collected dataset containing Covid-19 from https://ourworldindata.org/ related data including total cases, deaths, population, 
and vaccination progress across various countries and continents, 
the objective is to perform a comprehensive analysis to understand the impact of the pandemic.
This analysis should include examining factors such as infection rates, death rates, vaccination progress, 
and their variations across different geographical regions.

Solution:
Data Exploration: 
Begin by exploring the dataset to understand its structure and contents. Identify relevant variables such as location, date, total cases, total deaths, 
population, and vaccination data.

Total Cases vs Total Deaths: 
Calculate the death percentage to understand the likelihood of dying if contracting Covid-19 in different countries.

Total Cases vs Population: 
Determine the percentage of the population infected with Covid-19 in various locations to gauge the scale of the pandemic's spread.

Countries with Highest Infection Rate: Identify countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population size.

Countries with Highest Death Count: Determine countries with the highest death counts per population, indicating the severity of the pandemic's impact.

Breakdown by Continent: 
Analyze data on a continental level to identify continents with the highest death counts per population, providing insights into regional variations.

Global Numbers: 
Summarize global Covid-19 statistics including total cases, total deaths, and death percentages to understand the overall impact of the pandemic.

Total Population vs Vaccinations: 
Evaluate the progress of Covid-19 vaccinations by calculating the percentage of the population that has received at least one dose of the vaccine.

Data Manipulation Techniques: Utilize advanced SQL techniques such as Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Window Functions, and Aggregate Functions 
to perform complex calculations and analyses efficiently.

View Creation: Create a view to store the analyzed data for potential visualization and further exploration.

By conducting this analysis, we aim to gain insights into the spread and impact of Covid-19 globally and regionally, 
as well as to track the progress of vaccination efforts in combating the pandemic.
